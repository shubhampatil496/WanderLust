🏡 KumbhStay – Hostel Management System
📖 Overview

KumbhStay is a full-stack Hostel Management System built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, and EJS templating.
The project helps students and hostel owners list, manage, and explore hostels easily — similar to Airbnb, but designed for college hostels and budget accommodations.

It includes features like authentication, reviews, and image uploads, all integrated into a clean and responsive interface.

🚀 Key Features

Role-based access control — only authenticated users can add, edit, or delete listings.

🏠 Hostel Listings

Create new hostel listings with name, location, price, image, and description.

Edit or delete your own listings.

View all hostels in a clean grid-based interface.

📝 Reviews System

Add, edit, or delete reviews for each hostel.

Helps users share feedback and improve listing credibility.

🖼️ Image Uploads

Integrated Cloudinary API for image hosting and retrieval.

Supports multiple images per listing.
